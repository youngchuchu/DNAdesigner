   
Future tasks:    
Later on, we will need to add the option to perform these operations in reverse. What this means is that we will need to allow a user to input proteinDistance, dihedralAngle, and arcDepth. Then the program will output two appropriate TAL distances. The dihedral must also be associated somehow with a "likelihood of monomerization problems." And of course, it must also output a DNA sequence!

After this basic functionality is added, our next steps are to do a few different things.
1) It is absolutely vital that this functionality be extended to three or four tal monomers, AT THE VERY LEAST.
2) More complex shapes are less important but still would be absolutely excellent!!
3) An output to a .blend file is no longer vital. Our new focus is on visual output using openGL.
4) Finally, ALL OF THE WORK DONE HERE WITH THIS PROGRAM MUST BE VALIDATED EMPIRICALLY.
